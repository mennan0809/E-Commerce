## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+ and Maven installed
- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube) up and running
- Running instances of PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and RabbitMQ (or just use the Docker containers in the setup)

## Installation

#### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-db-ecommerce-backend.git
cd multi-db-ecommerce-backend
```
#### Build All Backend Microservices
Run the following commands one by one to build each Spring Boot service:
```bash
cd userservice
mvn clean package

cd ../productservice
mvn clean package

cd ../paymentservice
mvn clean package

cd ../orderservice
mvn clean package

cd ../api-gateway
mvn clean package
```

#### Run with Docker Compose
Build Docker images and start all services and dependencies in detached mode:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

#### Deploy on Kubernetes with Minikube
1. Start Minikube:
```bash 
minikube start 
```
2. Apply all Kubernetes manifests recursively:
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/ --recursive
```
3. Check that all pods are running and ready:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
4. Access the API Gateway service in your browser:
```bash
minikube service api-gateway
```

## API Documentation

A full Postman collection is included in the repository at:
```bash
/json/E-Commerce_Postman_Collection.json
```
Use this collection to explore and test all available API endpoints, including user management, product management, orders, payments, and more.
